## Overview
Welcome to the Projects Directory, a curated collection of professional DevOps and Cloud Computing projects. Each subdirectory represents an individual project, showcasing practical implementations of DevOps practices, cloud architecture designs, and automation workflows. These projects are designed to highlight industry-level expertise in modern infrastructure and software development practices. This repo is for cloud and devops projects and to speed things up, I will not be writing the web application codes, but rather pipelines, security as code, complaince as code, infrastructre as code and other cloudOps and DevOps operations.

## Directory Structure

The structure of this directory is as follows:

projects/
├── project-1/
├── project-2/
├── project-3/
├── ...
└── README.md

* Each subdirectory contains the files, configurations, and documentation specific to a project.
* Projects may focus on either DevOps or Cloud Computing, covering a range of topics like CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code (IaC), cloud architecture, and container orchestration.

## Project Highlights
Each project in this directory includes:

* Industry-Grade Solutions: Demonstrates scalable, secure, and performance-oriented designs.
* Practical Use Cases: Tackles real-world challenges in DevOps and Cloud Computing.
* Automation-First Approach: Leverages tools like Terraform, Kubernetes, Ansible, or Jenkins to automate processes.
* Detailed Documentation: Comprehensive setup and usage guides included within each project's subdirectory.

## Example Projects
## DevOps-Focused Projects
* CI/CD with Jenkins and Docker:
  * Builds and deploys applications using Jenkins pipelines and Docker containers.
  * Automates testing and production releases.
* Infrastructure as Code with Terraform:
  * Automates the provisioning of cloud infrastructure across AWS and Azure.
  * Demonstrates reusable and modular Terraform configurations.

## Cloud-Focused Projects
* Scalable Web Application on AWS:
  * Deploys a highly available web application using AWS services like EC2, S3, and RDS.
  * Implements load balancing and auto-scaling for high traffic.
* Multi-Cloud Deployment:

  * Integrates AWS and Azure to create a hybrid cloud environment.
  * Uses VPC peering and secure networking to ensure seamless communication.

## How to Use This Directory
* Navigate to the desired project subdirectory.
* Read the README.md file in the project directory for specific setup instructions.
* Follow the prerequisites and usage steps to deploy or test the project.

## General Prerequisites
* Knowledge: Understanding of DevOps and Cloud concepts.
* Tools:
  * Git
  * Terraform, Ansible, or other IaC tools (as specified in individual projects)
  * Docker and Kubernetes
  * AWS CLI / Azure CLI or other cloud provider tools
* Environment: Access to a local development environment or a cloud account.

The projects here may contain software code written by other developers which I used to build the artificats to be deployed on the infrastructure I have. If you are one of those and you do not find your name in the reference section of the repo in which you found your code, please visit my profile to find my contact and contact me asap.
